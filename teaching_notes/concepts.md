# Concepts in the alpha lab

Some rough notes on simple explanations. Most students do not have a physics background.

## Alpha decay and quantum tunneling
* The nucleus of eg. 232-U is unstable with respect to alpha decay
* If this is so, why does it take so long to decay (half-life  = 68.9 years)?
  - there is some kind of barrier
  - "alpha particle" is in a potential well of the nucleus (nuclear forces)
  - the nuclear force is a remnant of the strong force => very strong over nuclear distances
  - above the scale of nuclear distances, electromagnetic forces dominate
  - once through the barrier, the force is repulsive => emission
* Alpha particles can overcome the potential barrier via tunneling
  - small but finite probability
  - heuristic explanation with uncertainty principle and wavefunction treatment
  - the higher and wider the barrier, the lower the tunneling probability

## Common questions/discussion
* The physical mechanism of the formation of alpha particles within the nucleus
* The efficiency of Si detectors vs. scintillator detectors (used in the gamma and beta labs)
  - Si more efficient, although some e- lost via trapping and recombination
  - scintillator + PMT has many more stages of interaction
* Why is alpha sometime accompanied by a gamma?
  - alpha emission can result in an excited state of the nucleus
  - decyas via gamma emission
* What is the range of fission fragments vs. alpha particles
  - from the Bethe-Bloch equation: dE/dx ~ z<sup>2</sup>/beta<sup>2</sup>
  - fission fragments lose energy much faster
* Can one alpha decay channel result in more than one peak?
 - No
 - Two body decay conserves energy
 - The alpha particle is released from a discrete energy level of the nucleus
